# Home Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of linear regression to predict home prices based on their area. The model is built using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Project Overview

### 1. Data
The project uses two datasets:

- `homeprices.csv`: Contains the historical data of homes with their area (in square feet) and price (in USD).
- `areas.csv`: A file containing areas (in square feet) for which the prices will be predicted using the linear regression model.

### 2. Linear Regression Model
A linear regression model is used to predict the price of a home based on its area. The model is trained using the data from `homeprices.csv` and used to predict prices for new areas provided in `areas.csv`.

### 3. Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading**:
   The dataset `homeprices.csv` is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between the area (in square feet) and price (in USD).

3. **Linear Regression**:
   A linear regression model is created using the area as the independent variable and the price as the dependent variable.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The model is used to predict the price of homes with different areas, such as 3300 sq ft and 5000 sq ft.
   - The predicted prices are also applied to new data from the `areas.csv` file.

5. **Saving Predictions**:
   The predicted prices are stored in a new column `prices` in the `areas.csv` file and saved as a new CSV file called `prediction.csv`.

### 4. Code Walkthrough

- **Data Loading**:
   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv(r'c:\Users\sarka\Downloads\homeprices.csv')
   ```

- **Data Visualization**:
   ```python
   plt.scatter(df['area'], df['price'], color='red', marker='+')
   ```

- **Model Training**:
   ```python
   reg.fit(new_df, price)
   ```

- **Price Prediction for Specific Area**:
   ```python
   reg.predict([[3300]])
   ```

- **Using a New Dataset for Prediction**:
   ```python
   area_df = pd.read_csv("areas.csv")
   p = reg.predict(area_df)
   ```

- **Saving Predictions**:
   ```python
   area_df.to_csv("prediction.csv")
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your `homeprices.csv` and `areas.csv` files in the appropriate directory.
2. Modify the file paths in the script as needed.
3. Run the script to train the model and predict the prices.
4. The predicted prices will be saved in `prediction.csv`.

## File Structure

```
/project-directory
    ├── homeprices.csv    # Historical data of home prices
    ├── areas.csv         # Areas for which prices will be predicted
    ├── prediction.csv    # Predicted prices saved here
    └── home_price_model.py  # Python script for the linear regression model
```

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple linear regression implementation to predict home prices based on the area of the home. It's a basic demonstration of how machine learning models can be used for predictive analysis.

Feel free to modify the datasets and experiment with different types of regression models for more advanced predictions.
